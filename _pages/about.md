I’m an Agent Engineer at [Sierra.ai](https://sierra.ai/). I graduated with a Master’s in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences from UC Berkeley in May 2025, advised by Professor David Wagner. My research focused on training language models to follow an instruction hierarchy, specifically looking at improving system prompt robustness in LLMs and prompt injection robustness in reasoning models. Before that, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, also at UC Berkeley.
